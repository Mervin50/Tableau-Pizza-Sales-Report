# Introduction: 

Our pizza sales dashboard provides sales, marketing, operations, and executives with key insights to optimize promotions, logistics, and resource allocation. Key KPIs include revenue, average order value, pizza sales trends, and peak times to identify top/bottom-performing pizzas and improve decision-making.



# Problem Identification: 

Our sales dashboard identifies underperforming pizzas, inefficient discount strategies, and missed peak-hour opportunities by analyzing trends across categories, sizes, and customer segments. Interactive visualizations expose gaps—like weak-selling products or poorly timed promotions—enabling targeted fixes in marketing, pricing, and resource allocation.


# Solution Finding:

Our pizza sales dashboard in Tableau pinpoints underperforming products, inefficient discounts, and peak demand gaps—enabling data-driven fixes like menu optimization, targeted promotions, and staff scheduling. Interactive KPIs, trend analysis, and profit-margin visuals empower teams to boost revenue by addressing specific sales bottlenecks.


# Dashboard Design

Our dashboard design uses targeted visualizations—numeric KPIs for revenue/orders, butterfly charts for category performance, and bar/donut charts for top/bottom pizzas—to highlight sales trends and inefficiencies. Interactive filters, hourly/weekly trend graphs, and segmented color schemes simplify decision-making for menu optimization and staffing. A clean layout with tooltips, icons, and consistent spacing ensures clarity, while dynamic elements like sliders enable real-time analysis. The schematic prioritizes actionable insights, from peak sales hours to discount impacts, directly addressing pizza sales challenges.


# Discussion

Strengths: Our dashboard ensures clarity with clean layouts, consistent colors, and interactive filters, enabling data-driven decisions through focused KPIs and best/worst seller insights.

Limitations & Improvements: While visual complexity and information overload pose challenges, future enhancements like granular segmentation, historical trends, and customer feedback integration can deepen analysis and usability.


# Concluding remarks

Our dashboard delivers actionable sales insights through financial KPIs and best/worst seller analysis, though deeper segmentation and predictive features could enhance its power. Despite these limitations, it remains a visually clear and functionally robust tool for data-driven pizza sales optimization.
